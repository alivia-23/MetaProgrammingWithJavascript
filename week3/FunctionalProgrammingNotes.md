# The functional programming paradigm
##  Learning Objectives
* Be able to explain that there are several programming paradigms

* Be able to explain the basic difference between the two predominant programming paradigms: functional programming and object-oriented programming

* Understand, at a very high level, how the functional programming paradigm works*

"There are actually several styles of coding, also known as paradigms. A common style is called functional programming, or FP for short.

In functional programming, we use a lot of functions and variables.

`function getTotal(a,b) {
    return a + b
}
var num1 = 2;
var num2 = 3;

var total = getTotal(num1, num2);`
